# Learning Graphic Design Things Every Designer Should Know  
## My Two Cents  
Some of these are just problem solving / basic common sense ; of course experience.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Know your story: Part 1  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Know your story: Part 2  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Keep it simple: Part 1  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Keep it simple: Part 2  
Have pic of NYC at night landscape or a whole kitchen but need img 4 mobile?
Use pic of Lady Liberty, 1 item in kitchen.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Keep it simple: Part 3  
Nameplate, date folio, headlines, bg, img.
Nameplate is set in Helvetica Neue Light; its roundness matches the graphic.
Date folio, and headlines will be in the same font; 1 part of headline bold. Simple.
Headline is made up of two parts headline itself and the title of article. Articles will be in bold.
U could say the second design looks obvously less cluttered but mainly "more intentionally designed"

- Before
  ```
  > A Collection in Blue **Visions in Ice**  
  > Introducing **Michael Carlucci**  
  > Review **The amazing Nikon D3S digital SLR**
  ```
- After (Easier to scan but not visually interesting)
  ```
      A Collection in Blue Visions in Ice
      Introducing          Michael Carlucci
      Review               The amazing Nikon D3S digital SLR
  ```

- Better (Visually interesting "How done in movies")
  ```
      A Collection in Blue Visions in Ice
               Introducing Michael Carlucci
                    Review The amazing Nikon D3S digital SLR
  ```

## Have a focal point  
### Another way to keep things simple is to make sure your design has a Focal Point.##
1. Apples  
   a. **Descr:** all green apples  
   b. **Solution:** 1 red one thrown into mix  

2. 4 col mag article  
   a. **Descr:** 4 col magazine article in small hard to read font  
   b. **Solution:** A pic of women thrown into mix.  
   Now as read U think about how story relates to women (what pic of her is conveying)
   This makes it easier to read now.

3. Mag article title area  
   a. **Descr:** 4 WORD HEADLINE 4th on newline and its BIG AND **BOLD** AND RED  
   It matches a small pic of fire.
   b. **Solution:** "Anchors the copy"  

4. 2 col mag article  
   a. **Descr:** Magazine article with 2 cols having two graphics mixed in header logo at bottom.  
   b. Just make one graphic larger then other. Logo smaller then both.  

5. 3 col Brochure  
   a. **Descr:** 3 col mag/brochure article 4 hospital ea has headline above it.  
   Lists of info **bold**. HLs / list leads = blue font color.
   b. **Solution:** Main idea theme becomes page headline, word hope green rest HLs light orange.  
   "Tagline" above cols.
   3 pics interspersed in the HL. The main idea is further conveyed in ea <p> by being **bolded**.
   4 primary SVCs sep from <p> at bottom left ea is an HL w small descr below it.
   img in the <p> 2 butterfly graphics (match main HL) in gutters.

6. Book cover  
   a. **Descr:** "Things Wild" img of lizard in natural environment "Reptile & Insect Guide for Kids" "By Phile Zackman"  
   Title and 2nd part of title/author same size. Both half size of img.
   The margins are very small on tb little more on lr.
   b. **Solution:** Margins "huge" especially lr 50%. Margin bg darker then "book area" bg.  
   Title bigger then "subtitle" bigger then author.
   Lizard lifted from his environment. His tail wags in the margins.

## Get extreme  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Another kind of focal point, another way of getting simple is to do what I call Get Extreme


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Put white to work  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Unblock it  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Set type boldly  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Use beautiful color
